### How to run and view outputs

* Open the jupyter notebook file on your local machine.
* Install anaconda and install python libraries using pip. Required libraries: seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, tensorflow_datasets, sklearn.
* Run each cell. There is no GPU required to view outputs. Training can be done in very less time using the CPU as well.
* You can also view the outputs directly on github.
